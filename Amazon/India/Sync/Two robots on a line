we are not provided with the coordinates of both robots

Hence moving in opposite direction may leads to divergence 

Moreover we are expect the same code for the both robots
Hence we can't wake other robot to meet on reaching a parachute site by other explicitly

technique 1:

Move left 1 time
then right 2 times
then left 3 times
and so on...
Definetly after some point one robot will go over its own parachute and also parachute of another robot. 
At this point, it has met with the other robot.

technique 2:

If reached the point then move left 2 times 
else move left single time and stay for another unit of time.

This way one robot will double it’s speed as soon as it reaches the other’s parachute and eventually they will meet.
Note: Don’t move a robot with twice as speed as other from landing point onwards. As we don’t have any information which robot is behind and which robot is at front. 
So if front robot is moved with double speed than lagging behind robot then it will never be able to catch it hence, never meet.
void robotMeet()
{
  bool reached_parachute = 0;

  // Till both robots meet

    while( !did_robots_meet() )
    {
      // if reached move left twice
      if( reached_parachute )
      {
        moveLeft();
        moveLeft();
      }
      // Else walk left (slow) and stay
      else
      {
        moveLeft();
        no_movement();
      }
      // If reach the top of parachute
      if( onTop_of_Parachute() )
      {
        reached_parachute = 1;
      }
    }
}
