Where it can be:

1) Continous Subarray ( Window )
2) Window of fixed size 'k'
3) Operation like Max , Min , diff etc

What to do:
Maintain 2 pointers start ( st ) and end ( end ) for the window
Whenever the window doesn't satisfy the condition --> st++ ( Shrink )
else end++ (expand)

for condition check :
Data structure can be used like : deque<int> --> gives back() , front() --> O(1) 
set --> For sorted arrangement (distinct)
Multiset --> same like set + duplicates allowed
