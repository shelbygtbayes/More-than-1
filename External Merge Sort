Requirement when need to sort a large data ( from disk ) when limited RAM is available
Important at then time when we were having the taps rather than the Hard disk
Assume we have 5GB of Data which is to be sort using the 1GB of RAM
Step1
Read files of size 1GB from the disk created from the data(say f1 , f2...f5)
Sort the files and write to the disk (say f1_s , f2_s ... f5_s)

Step2
Now read Chunks from each sorted file of suitable size ( say 150MB )
Write the Chunk of each file to the RAM
After Write Operations, we are left with some space which will be using as output buffer ( 1024 - 150*5)

Step3
Apply k-way Merge Algorithm over the chunks and write the result to the output-buffer untill gets filled
When output buffer filled , Write the buffer file to the disk and empty the buffer
Continue the Merging Untill a chunk data got used
When a chunk got used, write another chunk from the same sorted file to the same allocated space

Continue Untill All chunks of each file written into the disk
