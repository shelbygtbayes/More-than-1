We have 25 horses and 5 tracks
Let's have 5 groups each having 5 horses ( A B C D E )
Now we have winner, say ( A1 , B1 , C1 , D1 , E1 ) of the 5 races
Let's have 1 more race among the winners
This time let's winner be ( A1 , B1 , C1 )
Total 6 races : we got the fastest horse ( A1 )
Now the last 2 horses of each group can be eliminated
Now since E1, D1 horses aren't much faster hence the horses of the group they belong can be eliminated too
Moreover C1 comes 3rd hence No need for the Horses of the same group ( since slower than C1 )
Now Since B1 come's second, But we can't say B2 faster than C1 
But Since B3 is slower than B2 ( and we are left with 2 rank positions ( 2nd and 3rd ) Hence we can eliminate it too.
Now we are left with 2 horses ( A2 , A3 ) from A and 2 horses from B ( B1,B2 ) and 1 horse from C ( C1 )
Conduct the last race to find the winner and runner up

Hence Total races = 7
