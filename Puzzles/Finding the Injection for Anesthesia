Extension of 1000 bottles and 10 rats

Here instead of binary numbers we represent the bottle using 3 bit values ( 0 , 1 , 2 )
0 --> No drink
1 --> drink on 1st day
2 --> drink on 2nd day

r1  r2  r3  r4  r5
1   1   2   0   1

Like same if bottle no : 11201 --> poison
then r1 r2 , r5 drinks on 1st day and r3 drinks on 2nd day

Hence using 3 values and 5 rats we can check 3*3*3*3*3 = 243 bottles
