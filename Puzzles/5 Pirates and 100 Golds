Let Pirates be P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5

consider ( 2 pirates last two left )
then partition would be 
P4    P5    Since vote %age = 50% Accepted but P5 got nothing
100   0

3 pirates
                  %age vote > 50%
P3    P4    P5    P5 will accept the scheme because he knew if P3 scheme not accepted and die then P4 will form the scheme
99    0     1     as above and he will not get anything

4 Pirates

P2  P3  P4  P5    %age vote = 50%
99  0   1   0     P4 will accept because if P2 die then P3 will form the above scheme and he will not get anything

5 Pirates

P1  P2  P3  P4  P5    %age vote > 50%
98  0   1   0    1   P3 and P5 both accept because if P1 die then both will not get anything from P2 scheme
