Answer : Knight can reach the Bottom visiting all squares if the board n = Odd

A knight move ( start -> black color then end -> white color ) and vice-versa
Since the color of Top left and bottom right are same  
Now to visit all squares we require N*N - 1 moves
Now if N -> even hence N*N -> even hence N*N-1 -> odd
Thus we get different colors

Now if N -> odd hence N*N -> odd hence N*N-1 -> even
Thus we get same colors --> satisfy our condition
